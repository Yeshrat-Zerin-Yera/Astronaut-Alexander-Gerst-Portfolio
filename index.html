            <h3>ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst</h3>
            <p> I am a European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut. In 2014 I spent six months on the International Space
                Station for ESA's Blue Dot mission. I am now back in space on his second mission called Horizons where
                I will take over as Station commander for Expedition 57. I am a geophysicist and volcanologist.

            <h3>Geophysicist Alexander Gerst</h3>
            <p> I have graduated from the Technical High School in Öhringen, Germany, in 1995. While in high school, I
                volunteered as a scout leader, firefighter, and water rescue lifeguard.
                I studied at the University of Karlsruhe (now Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), Germany, where I
                received a degree in geophysics with distinction.

                <h1>Expedition 40</h1>
                <h3>13 May 2014 UTC-10 September 2014 UTC</h3>
                <p> Expedition 40 was the 40th expedition to the International Space Station. A portion of the
                    Expedition 39 crew transferred to Expedition 40 while the remainder of the crew launched on May 28,
                    2014 from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
                    Upon achieving orbit approximately nine minutes after launch, Soyuz TMA-13M, delivering the
                    remainder of the crew, began a four-orbit rendezvous with the International Space Station. Soyuz
                    TMA-13M subsequently docked with the Rassvet module of the ISS at 1:44 UTC on May 29.
